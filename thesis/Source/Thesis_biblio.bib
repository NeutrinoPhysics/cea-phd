abstract = {I apply the well controlled Hydro-PM approximation of Gnedin & Hui to model the column density distribution of the Lyman-alpha forest for 25 different flat cosmological scenarios, including variants of the standard CDM, tilted CDM, CDM with a cosmological constant, and CHDM models. I show that within the accuracy of the HPM approximation the slope of the column density distribution reflects the degree of nonlinearity of the cosmic gas distribution and is a function of the rms linear density fluctuation at the characteristic filtering scale only. The amplitude of the column density distribution, expressed as the value for the ionizing intensity, is derived as a function of the cosmological parameters (to about 40% accuracy). The observational data are currently consistent with the value for the ionizing intensity being constant in the redshift interval z$\sim$2-4.},

abstract = {The z > 2 Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest traces the underlying dark-matter distribution on large scales and, given sufficient sightlines, can be used to create 3D maps of large-scale structure. We examine the observational requirements to construct such maps and estimate the signal-to-noise as a function of exposure time and sightline density. Sightline densities at z = 2.25 are n_los = [360, 1200,3300] deg^{-2} at limiting magnitudes of g =[24.0, 24.5,25.0], resulting in transverse sightline separations of d_perp = [3.6, 1.9, 1.2] h^{-1} Mpc, which roughly sets the reconstruction scale. We simulate these reconstructions using mock spectra with realistic noise properties, and find that spectra with S/N = 4 per angstrom can be used to generate maps that clearly trace the underlying dark-matter at overdensities of rho/<rho> $\sim$ 1. For the VLT/VIMOS spectrograph, exposure times t_exp = [4, 6, 10] hrs are sufficient for maps with spatial resolution epsilon_3d = [5.0, 3.2, 2.3] h^{-1} Mpc. Assuming $\sim$ 250 h^{-1} Mpc is probed along the line-of-sight, 1 deg^2 of survey area would cover a comoving volume of $\sim$ 10^6 h^{-3} Mpc^3 at <z>=2.3, enabling efficient mapping of large volumes with 8-10m telescopes. These maps could be used to study galaxy environments, detect proto-clusters, and study the topology of large-scale structure at high-z.},

@article{Schlegel2011,
abstract = {BigBOSS is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square degrees. It has been conditionally accepted by NOAO in response to a call for major new instrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800. Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic targets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In particular, targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0, extending the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller scales, and detect redshift space distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional constraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by measuring the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5 quasars. BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the broadband power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar spectra, achieves a FOM of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors. This FOM is based on conservative assumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow to over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave numbers (kmax = 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of modified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to 0.024 eV accuracy.},

Within this theory, the only candidates for dark matter particles are sterile right-handed neutrinos with masses of a few keV. Requiring that these neutrinos explain entirely the (warm) dark matter, we find that their number is at least three. We show that, in the minimal choice of three sterile neutrinos, the mass of the lightest active neutrino is smaller than O ( 10 ‚àí5 )  eV , which excludes the degenerate mass spectra of three active neutrinos and fixes the absolute mass scale of the other two active neutrinos.

  abstract={It has been pointed out by one of the authors (Shaposhnikov2008 Preprint 0804.4542 [http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4542] ) that in the ŒΩMSM (Standard Model extended with three right-handed neutrinos with masses smaller than the electroweak scale), there is a corner in the parameter space where CP -violating resonant oscillations among the two heaviest right-handed neutrinos continue to operate below the freeze-out temperature of sphaleron transitions, leading to a lepton asymmetry which is considerably larger than the baryon asymmetry. Consequently, the lightest right-handed ('sterile') neutrinos, which may serve as dark matter, are generated through an efficient resonant mechanism proposed by Shi and Fuller(1999 Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 2832 [astro-ph/9810076]). We re-compute the dark matter relic density and non-eq uilibrium momentum distribution function in this situation with quantum field theoretic methods and, confronting the results with existing astrophysical data, derive bounds on the properties of the lightest right-handed neutrinos. Our spectra can be used as an input for structure formation simulations in warm dark matter cosmologies, for a Lyman-Œ± analysis of the dark matter distribution on small scales, and for studying the properties of haloes of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.}

  abstract={Resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are considered an attractive dark matter (DM) candidate only requiring a minimal, well motivated extension to the standard model of particle physics. With a particle mass restricted to the keV range, sterile neutrinos are furthermore a prime candidate for warm DM, characterised by suppressed matter perturbations at the smallest observable scales. In this paper we take a critical look at the validity of the resonant scenario in the context of constraints from structure formation. We compare predicted and observed number of Milky-Way satellites and we introduce a new method to generalise existing Lyman-Œ± limits based on thermal relic warm DM to the case of resonant sterile neutrino DM . The tightest limits come from the Lyman-Œ± analysis, excluding the entire parameter space (at 2-œÉ confidence level) still allowed by X-ray observations. Constraints from Milky-Way satellite counts are less stringent, leaving room for resonant sterile neutrino DM most notably around the suggested line signal at 7.1 keV.}

  abstract={We perform a detailed and illustrative study of the production of keV sterile neutrino Dark Matter (DM) by decays of singlet scalars in the early Universe. In the current study we focus on providing a clear and general overview of this production mechanism. For the first time we study all regimes possible on the level of momentum distribution functions, which we obtain by solving a system of Boltzmann equations. These quantities contain the full information about the production process, which allows us to not only track the evolution of the DM generation but to also take into account all bounds related to the spectrum, such as constraints from structure formation or from avoiding too much dark radiation. In particular we show that this simple production mechanism can, depending on the regime, lead to strongly non-thermal DM spectra which may even feature more than one peak in the momentum distribution. These cases could have particularly interesting consequences for cosmological structure formation, as their analysis requires more refined tools than the simplistic estimate using the free-streaming horizon. Here we present the mechanism including all concepts and subtleties involved, for now using the assumption that the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom is constant during DM production, which is applicable in a significant fraction of the parameter space. This allows us to derive analytical results to back up our detailed numerical computations, thus leading to the most comprehensive picture of keV sterile neutrino DM production by singlet scalar decays that exists up to now.}

abstract = {The increasing size of cosmological simulations has led to the need for new visualization techniques. We focus on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamical (SPH) simulations run with the GADGET code and describe methods for visually accessing the entire simulation at full resolution. The simulation snapshots are rastered and processed on supercomputers into images that are ready to be accessed through a web interface (GigaPan). This allows any scientist with a web-browser to interactively explore simulation datasets in both in spatial and temporal dimensions, datasets which in their native format can be hundreds of terabytes in size or more. We present two examples, the first a static terapixel image of the MassiveBlack simulation, a P-GADGET SPH simulation with 65 billion particles, and the second an interactively zoomable animation of a different simulation with more than one thousand frames, each a gigapixel in size. Both are available for public access through the GigaPan web interface. We also make our imaging software publicly available.},

@article{Munshi2011,
abstract = {We study the effect of the non-Gaussianity induced by gravitational evolution upon the statistical properties of absorption in quasar (QSO) spectra. Using the generic hierarchical ansatz and the lognormal approximation we derive the analytical expressions for the one-point PDF as well as for the joint two-point probability distribution (2PDF) of transmitted fluxes in two neighbouring QSOs. These flux PDFs are constructed in 3D as well as in projection (i.e. in 2D). The PDFs are constructed by relating the lower-order moments, i.e. cumulants and cumulant correlators, of the fluxes to the 3D neutral hydrogen distribution which is, in turn, expressed as a function of the underlying dark matter distribution. The lower-order moments are next modelled using a generating function formalism in the context of a {\em minimal tree-model} for the higher-order correlation hierarchy. These different approximations give nearly identical results for the range of redshifts probed, and we also find a very good agreement between our predictions and outputs of hydrodynamical simulations. The formalism developed here for the joint statistics of flux-decrements concerning two lines of sight can be extended to multiple lines of sight, which could be particularly important for the 3D reconstruction of the cosmic web from QSO spectra (e.g. in the BOSS survey). These statistics probe the underlying projected neutral hydrogen field and are thus linked to "hot-spots" of absorption. The results for the PDF and the bias presented here use the same functional forms of scaling functions that have previously been employed for the modelling of other cosmological observation such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.},

abstract = {Aims. The small-scale nature of spacetime can be tested with observations of distant quasars. We comment on a recent paper by Tamburini et al. (A&A, 533, 71) which claims that Hubble Space Telescope observations of the most distant quasars place severe constraints on models of foamy spacetime. Methods. If space is foamy on the Planck scale, photons emitted from distant objects will accumulate uncertainties in distance and propagation directions thus affecting the expected angular size of a compact object as a function of redshift. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate distance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We also address the mechanics of carrying out such a test. We draw upon our previously published work on this subject (Christiansen et al. 2011), which carried out similar tests as Tamburini et al. and also went considerably beyond their work in several respects. Results. When calculating the path taken by photons as they travel from a distant source to Earth, one must use the comoving distance rather than the luminosity distance. This then also becomes the appropriate distance to use when calculating the angular broadening expected in a distant source. The use of the wrong distance measure causes Tamburini et al. to overstate the constraints that can be placed on models of spacetime foam. In addition, we consider the impact of different ways of parametrizing and measuring the effects of spacetime foam. Given the variation of the shape of the point-spread function (PSF) on the chip, as well as observation-specific factors, it is important to select carefully -- and document -- the comparison stars used as well as the methods used to compute the Strehl ratio.},

abstract = {We measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS galaxy sample. Combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernova (SN) and additional baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, we find upper 95 percent confidence limits of the neutrino mass \Sigma m_{\nu}<0.340 eV within a flat \Lambda CDM background, and \Sigma m_{\nu}<0.821 eV, assuming a more general background cosmological model. The number of neutrino species is measured to be N_{eff}=4.308\pm0.794 and N_{eff}=4.032^{+0.870}_{-0.894} for these two cases respectively. We study and quantify the effect of several factors on the neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, the effect of redshift-space distortion, the cutoff scale of the power spectrum, and the choice of additional data. The impact of neutrinos with unknown masses on other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. The fractional matter density and the Hubble parameter are measured to be \Omega_M=0.2796\pm0.0097, H_0=69.72^{+0.90}_{-0.91} km/s/Mpc (flat \Lambda CDM) and \Omega_M=0.2798^{+0.0132}_{-0.0136}, H_0=73.78^{+3.16}_{-3.17} km/s/Mpc (more general background model). Based on a Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, we find that w=-1 is consistent with observations, even allowing for neutrinos. Similarly, the curvature \Omega_K and the running of the spectral index \alpha_s are both consistent with zero. The tensor-to-scaler ratio is constrained down to r<0.198 (95 percent CL, flat \Lambda CDM) and r<0.440 (95 percent CL, more general background model).},

This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high metallicity stars.},

abstract = {The imprint of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) on the matter power spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the intergalactic medium as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-alpha forest of 10^5 quasars will be observed in the redshift range 2.2<z<3.5 and over 10,000 deg^2. We simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO scale determination provided by such a large scale survey. In particular, we discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the unabsorbed intrinsic quasar spectrum. The volume of current N-body simulations being too small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations. We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with that of the Horizon N-body simulation with the same initial conditions. Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-\alpha forest were generated; their power spectrum was computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical error expected from the BOSS survey. We confirm the results from Fisher matrix estimate. In the absence of error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum, the BOSS quasar survey should measure the BAO scale with an error of the order of 2.3%, or the transverse and radial BAO scales separately with errors of the order of 6.8% and 3.9%, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed by an average \Delta\chi^2=17 but for individual realizations \Delta\chi^2 ranges from 2 t o 35. The error on the unabsorbed quasar spectrum increases the error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20% and results in a sub percent bias.},

The problem of estimating the acceleration vector from a magnitude-limited redshift survey and the anisotropy of the galaxy clustering patterns are studied, restricting attention to large scales for which linear theory should be applicable. The determination of the density parameter from the Galaxy's infall to the local supercluster is addressed, and the influence of peculiar velocities on the morphology of clustering in the transition between the linear and nonlinear regimes is investigated.},

abstract = {We present the Data Release 10 Quasar (DR10Q) catalog from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. The catalog includes all BOSS objects that were targeted as quasar candidates during the first 2.5 years of the survey and that are confirmed as quasars via visual inspection of the spectra. The catalog also includes known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were reobserved by BOSS. The catalog contains 166,583 quasars (74,454 are new discoveries since SDSS-DR9) detected over 6,373 deg$^{2}$ with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra. The number of quasars with $z>2.15$ (117,668) is $\sim$5 times greater than the number of $z>2.15$ quasars known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (CIV, CIII, MgII). The catalog identifies 16,461 broad absorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object, the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag and information on the optical morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3,600-10,500\AA\ at a spectral resolution in the range 1,300$<$R$<$2,500; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog Archive Server. We also provide a supplemental list of an additional 2,376 quasars that have been identified among the galaxy targets of the SDSS-III/BOSS.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

@article{Orban2012,
abstract = {In setting up initial conditions for cosmological N-body simulations there are, fundamentally, two choices: either maximizing the correspondence of the initial density field to the assumed fourier-space clustering or, instead, matching to the real-space clustering. As a stringent test of both approaches, I perform ensembles of simulations using power law models and exploit the self-similarity of these initial conditions to quantify the accuracy of the results. Originally proposed by Pen 1997 and implemented by Sirko 2005, I show that the real-space motivated approach, which allows the DC mode to vary, performs well in exhibiting the expected self-similar behavior in the mean xi(r) and P(k) and in both methods this behavior extends below the scale of the initial mean interparticle spacing. I also test the real-space method with simulations of a simplified, powerlaw model for baryon acoustic oscillations, again with success, and mindful of the need to generate mock catalogs using simulations I show extensive powerlaw tests for the halo mass function and halo bias in our simulations. Although requiring a few to many times more simulations than the standard, fourier-space method to reach a given certainty on the correlation function or power spectrum, I find that the real-space method is more reliable for modeling P(k) when the clustering level becomes significant on the scale of the simulation box. As such a carefully-constructed real-space approach could be optimal for simulating extremely red power spectra (n_eff < -2), as in excessively small box simulations to model the "end" of the CDM hierarchy. I conclude by discussing some possibilities for optimizing the real-space method for more general use and an appendix demonstrates the potential for using perturbation theory to model the effect of the box scale on the simulated growth of structure.},

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 < z < 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.},

abstract = {The intergalactic medium was not completely reionized until approximately a billion years after the Big Bang, as revealed by observations of quasars with redshifts of less than 6.5. It has been difficult to probe to higher redshifts, however, because quasars have historically been identified in optical surveys, which are insensitive to sources at redshifts exceeding 6.5. Here we report observations of a quasar (ULAS J112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULAS J1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3 √ó 10(13)L(‚äô) and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2 √ó 10(9)M(‚äô) (where L(‚äô) and M(‚äô) are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULAS J1120+0641 is 1.9 megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULAS J1120+0641 exceeded 0.1.},

@article{Christiansen2011,
abstract = {Plausibly spacetime is "foamy" on small distance scales, due to quantum fluctuations. We elaborate on the proposal to detect spacetime foam by looking for seeing disks in the images of distant quasars and AGNs. This is a null test in the sense that the continued presence of unresolved "point" sources at the milli-arc second level in samples of distant compact sources puts severe constraints on theories of quantized spacetime foam at the Planckian level. We discuss the geometry of foamy spacetime, and the appropriate distance measure for calculating the expected angular broadening. We then deal with recent data and the constraints they put on spacetime foam models. While time lags from distant pulsed sources such as GRBs have been posited as a possible test of spacetime foam models, we demonstrate that the time-lag effect is rather smaller than has been calculated, due to the equal probability of positive and negative fluctuations in the speed of light inherent in such models. Thus far, images of high-redshift quasars from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) provide the most stringent test of spacetime foam theories. While random walk models ($\alpha = 1/2$) have already been ruled out, the holographic ($\alpha=2/3$) model remains viable. Here $\alpha \sim 1$ parametrizes the different spacetime foam models according to which the fluctuation of a distance $l$ is given by $\sim l^{1 - \alpha} l_P^{\alpha}$ with $l_P$ being the Planck length. Indeed, we see a slight wavelength-dependent blurring in the UDF images selected for this study. Using existing data in the {\it Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} archive we find it is impossible to rule out the $\alpha=2/3$ model, but exclude all models with $\alpha<0.65$. By comparison, current GRB time lag observations only exclude models with $\alpha<0.3$.},

abstract = {A combined N--body/SPH code is presented which benefits from the high speed of the special purpose hardware GRAPE (GRAvity PipE). Besides gravitational forces, GRAPE also returns the list of neighbours and can, therefore, be used to speed up the hydrodynamical part, too. After the interaction list has been passed, density, pressure forces, propagation and interpolation of particles etc. are calculated on the front end, a 50 MHz SUN SPARC 10. In order to combine SPH and GRAPE, possible limitations due to the hardware design of GRAPE are carefully analyzed and modifications compared to current SPH codes are discussed. The resulting code, GRAPESPH, is similarly flexible as TREESPH. It seems especially well suited to investigate the formation of individual objects in a large scale structure environment, like eg. galaxies or clusters. The total performance is at least half as good as treesph on a CRAY and for most applications it seems to be even better. The CPU time per time step is only slightly dependent on the clustering state. GRAPESPH, therefore, provides a very attractive alternative to the use of supercomputers in cosmology.},

abstract = {There are a number of different phenomena in the early universe that have to be studied numerically with lattice simulations. This paper presents a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated Python program called PyCOOL that solves the evolution of scalar fields in a lattice with very precise symplectic integrators. The program has been written with the intention to hit a sweet spot of speed, accuracy and user friendliness. This has been achieved by using the Python language with the PyCUDA interface to make a program that is easy to adapt to different scalar field models. In this paper we derive the symplectic dynamics that govern the evolution of the system and then present the implementation of the program in Python and PyCUDA. The functionality of the program is tested in a chaotic inflation preheating model, a single field oscillon case and in a supersymmetric curvaton model which leads to Q-ball production. We have also compared the performance of a consumer graphics card to a professional Tesla compute card in these simulations. We find that the program is not only accurate but also very fast. To further increase the usefulness of the program we have equipped it with numerous post-processing functions that provide useful information about the cosmological model. These include various spectra and statistics of the fields. The program can be additionally used to calculate the generated curvature perturbation. The program is publicly available under GNU General Public License at https://github.com/jtksai/PyCOOL .

abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe WMAP has mapped the entire sky in five frequency bands between 23 and 94 GHz with polarization sensitive radiometers. We present three-year full-sky maps of the polarization and analyze them for foreground emission and cosmological implications. These observations open up a new window for understanding the universe. WMAP observes significant levels of polarized foreground emission due to both Galactic synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission. The least contaminated channel is at 61 GHz. Informed by a model of the Galactic foreground emission, we subtract the foreground emission from the maps. In the foreground corrected maps, for l=2-6, we detect l(l+1) C_l^{EE} / (2 pi) = 0.086 +-0.029 microkelvin^2. This is interpreted as the result of rescattering of the CMB by free electrons released during reionization and corresponds to an optical depth of tau = 0.10 +- 0.03. We see no evidence for B-modes, limiting them to l(l+1) C_l^{BB} / (2 pi) = -0.04 +- 0.03 microkelvin^2. We find that the limit from the polarization signals alone is r<2.2 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit on the cosmic density of gravitational waves of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 5 times 10^{-12}. From the full WMAP analysis, we find r<0.55 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 10^{-12} (95% CL).},

abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) surveyed 14,555 square degrees, and delivered over a trillion pixels of imaging data. We present a study of galaxy clustering using 900,000 luminous galaxies with photometric redshifts, spanning between $z=0.45$ and $z=0.65$, constructed from the SDSS using methods described in Ross et al. (2011). This data-set spans 11,000 square degrees and probes a volume of $3h^{-3} \rm{Gpc}^3$, making it the largest volume ever used for galaxy clustering measurements. We present a novel treatment of the observational systematics and its applications to the clustering signals from the data set. In this paper, we measure the angular clustering using an optimal quadratic estimator at 4 redshift slices with an accuracy of $\sim$15% with bin size of delta_l = 10 on scales of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (at l$\sim$40-400). We derive cosmological constraints using the full-shape of the power-spectra. For a flat Lambda CDM model, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 (WMAP7) and H_0 constraints from 600 Cepheids observed by HST, we find \Omega_\Lambda = 0.73 +/- 0.019 and H_0 to be 70.5 +/- 1.6 km/s/Mpc. For an open Lambda CDM model, when combined with WMAP7 + HST, we find $\Omega_K = 0.0035 +/- 0.0054, improved over WMAP7+HST alone by 40%. For a wCDM model, when combined with WMAP7+HST+SN, we find w = -1.071 +/- 0.078, and H_0 to be 71.3 +/- 1.7 km/s/Mpc, which is competitive with the latest large scale structure constraints from large spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) (Reid et al. 2010, Percival et al. 2010, Montesano et al. 2011) and WiggleZ (Blake et al. 2011). The SDSS-III Data Release 8 (SDSS-III DR8) Angular Clustering Data allows a wide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion (via BAO), Gaussianity of initial conditions and neutrino masses.

@article{Zaldarriaga2001,
abstract = {We use published measurements of the transmission power spectrum of the Lyman alpha forest to constrain several parameters that describe cosmology and thermal properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). A 6 parameter grid is constructed using Particle-Mesh dark matter simulations together with scaling relations to make predictions for the gas properties. We fit for all parameters simultaneously and identify several degeneracies. We find that the temperature of the IGM can be well determined from the fall-off of the power spectrum at small scales. We find a temperature around 20.000 K, dependent on the slope of the gas equation of state. We see no evidence for evolution in the IGM temperature. We place constraints on the amplitude of the dark matter fluctuations. However, contrary to previous results, the slope of the dark matter power spectrum is poorly constrained. This is due to uncertainty in the effective Jeans smoothing scale, which depends on the temperature as well as the thermal history of the gas.},

abstract = {We measure the acoustic scale from the angular power spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Data Release 8 imaging catalog that includes 872,921 galaxies over $\sim$ 10,000 deg^2 between 0.45<z<0.65. The extensive spectroscopic training set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) luminous galaxies allows precise estimates of the true redshift distributions of galaxies in our imaging catalog. Utilizing the redshift distribution information, we build templates and fit to the power spectra of the data, which are measured in our companion paper, Ho et al. 2011, to derive the location of Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) while marginalizing over many free parameters to exclude nearly all of the non-BAO signal. We derive the ratio of the angular diameter distance to the sound horizon scale D_A/r_s= 9.212 + 0.416 -0.404 at z=0.54, and therefore, D_A= 1411+- 65 Mpc at z=0.54; the result is fairly independent of assumptions on the underlying cosmology. Our measurement of angular diameter distance D_A is 1.4 \sigma higher than what is expected for the concordance LCDM (Komatsu et al. 2011), in accordance to the trend of other spectroscopic BAO measurements for z >$\sim$ 0.35. We report constraints on cosmological parameters from our measurement in combination with the WMAP7 data and the previous spectroscopic BAO measurements of SDSS (Percival et al. 2010) and WiggleZ (Blake et al. 2011). We refer to our companion papers (Ho et al. 2011; de Putter et al. 2011) for investigations on information of the full power spectrum.},

abstract = {The signature left in quasar spectra by the presence of neutral hydrogen in the Universe allows one to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses with unprecedented sensitivity, with respect to laboratory experiments. At the forefront between particle physics and cosmology, this may also shed a new light on the neutrino mass hierarchy, and on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. In addition, constrains on cosmological parameters and on the dark energy equation of state can be derived, from a joint parameter estimation. This however requires a detailed modeling of the line-of-sight power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-alpha forest on scales ranging from a few to hundreds of Mpcs, which in turns demands for the inclusion and careful treatment of cosmological neutrinos. In particular, since massive neutrinos are known to significantly alter structure formation, one needs to quantify their free-streaming effect consistently. We develop here a new hydrodynamical code which incorporates cold dark matter, gas, and also reproduces the impact of massive neutrinos on the one-dimensional power spectrum with a novel technique. In synergy with corresponding experimental work from state-of-the-art surveys such as BOSS, and with other large-scale-structure probes (i.e. Planck), this will allow one to constrain the sum of the neutrino massses and the main cosmological parameters with unprecedented statistical significance. The theoretical study presented here will be combined with topological techniques to investigate dark energy and the expansion history of the Universe directly from the LyA transmitted flux. The method will be also relevant for BigBOSS, which is expected to produce several high-redshift Ly-alpha forest cloud data along distant QSOs, and the data will be used to study the line-of-sight one-dimensional fluctuations.},

@article{Petkova2010,
abstract = {We present a numerical implementation of radiative transfer based on an explicitly photon-conserving advection scheme, where radiative fluxes over the cell interfaces of a structured or unstructured mesh are calculated with a second-order reconstruction of the intensity field. The approach employs a direct discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with adjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the optically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of the scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of directional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of these "cone-fields" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a function of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light (or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger timesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer equation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well as with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations induced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is small and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat each source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only limited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a small number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the rest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion approximation. We have implemented the method in the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}, where it is coupled to the hydrodynamics in an operator splitting approach that subcycles the radiative transfer alternatingly with the hydrodynamical evolution steps.},

These have often been treated as two separate problems and different analysis techniques have been developed for both. We show that there exists a simple relation between the optimal solutions to the two problems, allowing to solve for both within the same formalism. This allows one to apply computational techniques developed for one method to the other, which often leads to a significant reduction in the computational time. It also provides a self consistent treatment of linear reconstruction by optimally computing the power spectrum from the data itself.},

abstract = {BigBOSS is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square degrees. It has been conditionally accepted by NOAO in response to a call for major new instrumentation and a high-impact science program for the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800. Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic targets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In particular, targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0, extending the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller scales, and detect redshift space distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional constraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by measuring the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5 quasars. BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the broadband power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar spectra, achieves a FOM of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors. This FOM is based on conservative assumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow to over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave numbers (kmax = 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of modified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to 0.024 eV accuracy.},

abstract = {We have performed the first-ever numerical N- body simulation of the full observable universe (DEUS "Dark Energy Universe Simulation" FUR "Full Universe Run"). This has evolved 550 billion particles on an Adaptive Mesh Refinement grid with more than two trillion computing points along the entire evolutionary history of the universe and across 6 order of magnitudes length scales, from the size of the Milky Way to that of the whole observable universe. To date, this is the largest and most advanced cosmological simulation ever run. It provides unique information on the formation and evolution of the largest structure in the universe and an exceptional support to future observational programs dedicated to mapping the distribution of matter and galaxies in the universe. The simulation has run on 4752 (of 5040) thin nodes of BULL supercomputer CURIE, using more than 300 TB of memory for 10 million hours of computing time. About 50 PBytes of data were generated throughout the run. Using an advanced and innovative reduction workflow the amount of useful stored data has been reduced to 500 TBytes.},

Based on mock quasar spectra from hydrodynamic simulations with cold dark matter, baryons and neutrinos, we find that the probability distribution of weak Lyman-alpha absorption features, as sampled by Lyman-alpha flux regions at high transmissivity, is strongly affected by the presence of massive neutrinos, when the amplitude of the matter power spectrum is fixed on large scales from measurements of the microwave background anisotropies. The application of the derived statistic to observed quasar spectra would provide a new sensitive measure of neutrino masses.},

abstract = {Statistical measures of galaxy clusters are sensitive to neutrino masses in the sub-eV range. We explore the possibility of using cluster number counts from the ongoing PLANCK/SZ and future cosmic-variance-limited surveys to constrain neutrino masses from CMB data alone. The precision with which the total neutrino mass can be determined from SZ number counts is limited mostly by uncertainties in the clusters mass function; these are explicitly accounted for in our forecast. We find that projected results from the PLANCK/SZ survey can be used to determine the total neutrino mass with a ($1\sigma$) uncertainty of 0.08-0.11 eV, assuming fiducial neutrino mass in the range 0.1-0.3 eV, if the survey detection limit is set at the $5\sigma$ significance level. This improves on the limits expected from PLANCK/CMB lensing measurements by a factor 1.5-2. With a cosmic-variance-limited SZ survey we obtain ($1\sigma$) uncertainty of 0.05-0.07 eV. Combined PLANCK and the X-ray RASS cluster catalogs could constrain $M_{\nu}$ at the 0.04 and 0.07, assuming fiducial neutrino masses 0.1 and 0.3 eV, respectively. A few percent uncertainty in the mass function parameters could result in a factor of up to $\sim 50%$ degradation of our PLANCK, CVL and PLANCK+RASS forecasts. The latter two, which significantly benefit from cluster surveys, are more prone to mass function uncertainty. This degradation becomes less significant for neutrino masses 0.3 eV or higher. This highlights the relevance of mass function uncertainties for cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis shows that if the (total) neutrino mass is close to the lower limits deduced from neutrino oscillation experiments, cluster number counts provide a viable complimentary cosmological probe to CMB lensing constraints on $M_{\nu}$.},

abstract = {We have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition to large-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. We use the WiggleZ survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume of $\sim$1 (Gpc/h)^3. A new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented, which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic depth of WiggleZ (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number of galaxies N(<r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r^3 within 1%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1% of D_2=3, at radii larger than 71 \pm 8 Mpc/h at z$\sim$0.2, 70 \pm 5 Mpc/h at z$\sim$0.4, 81 \pm 5 Mpc/h at z$\sim$0.6, and 75 \pm 4 Mpc/h at z$\sim$0.8. We demonstrate the robustness of our results against selection function effects, using a LCDM N-body simulation and a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. The results are in excellent agreement with both the LCDM N-body simulation and an analytical LCDM prediction. We can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension below D_2=2.97 on scales from $\sim$80 Mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by our measurement, $\sim$300 Mpc/h, at 99.99% confidence.},

abstract = {Measurement of redshift-space distortions (RSD) offers an attractive method to directly probe the cosmic growth history of density perturbations. A distribution function approach where RSD can be written as a sum over density weighted velocity moment correlators has recently been developed. We use Nbody simulations to investigate the individual contributions and convergence of this expansion for dark matter. If the series is expanded as a function of powers of mu, cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, there are a finite number of terms contributing at each order. We present these terms and investigate their contribution to the total as a function of wavevector k. For mu^2 the correlation between density and momentum dominates on large scales. Higher order corrections, which act as a Finger-of-God (FoG) term, contribute 1% at k$\sim$0.015h/Mpc, 10% at k$\sim$0.05h/Mpc at z=0, while for k>0.15h/Mpc they dominate and make the total negative. These higher order terms are dominated by density-energy density correlations which contribute negatively to the power, while the contribution from vorticity part of momentum density auto-correlation is an order of magnitude lower. For mu^4 term the dominant term on large scales is the scalar part of momentum density auto-correlation, while higher order terms dominate for k>0.15h/Mpc. For mu^6 and mu^8 we find it has very little power for k<0.15h/Mpc. We also compare the expansion to the full 2D P^ss(k,mu) as well as to their multipoles. For these statistics an infinite number of terms contribute and we find that the expansion achieves percent level accuracy for kmu<0.15h/Mpc at 6th order, but breaks down on smaller scales because the series is no longer perturbative. We explore resummation of the terms into FoG kernels, which extend the convergence up to a factor of 2 in scale. We find that the FoG kernels are approximately Lorentzian.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian SPH technique, or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with adaptive mesh refinement. Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code AREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. (abridged)},

abstract = {We present the design and performance of the multi-object fiber spectrographs for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally commissioned in Fall 1999 on the 2.5-m aperture Sloan Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the spectrographs produced more than 1.5 million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II surveys, enabling a wide variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science including the first observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The spectrographs were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the flagship survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Lyman-alpha absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 square degrees of sky, making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic distance scale of the Universe and placing tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. The twin multi-object fiber spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout with reflective collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and state-of-the-art CCD detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in two channels over a bandpass covering the near ultraviolet to the near infrared, with a resolving power R = \lambda/FWHM $\sim$ 2000. Building on proven heritage, the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase holographic gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 < \lambda < 1000 nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to 1000 per exposure. In this paper we describe the original SDSS spectrograph design and the upgrades implemented for BOSS, and document the predicted and measured performances.},

abstract = {We combine the Ly-alpha forest power spectrum (LYA) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and high resolution spectra with cosmic microwave background (CMB) including 3-year WMAP, and supernovae (SN) and galaxy clustering constraints to derive new constraints on cosmological parameters. The existing LYA power spectrum analysis is supplemented by constraints on the mean flux decrement derived using a principle component analysis for quasar continua, which improves the LYA constraints on the linear power. We find some tension between the WMAP3 and LYA power spectrum amplitudes, at the $\sim$2 sigma level, which is partially alleviated by the inclusion of other observations: we find \sigma_8=0.85\pm 0.02 compared to sigma_8=0.80 \pm 0.03 without LYA. For the slope we find ns=0.965\pm0.012. We find no evidence for the running of the spectral index in the combined analysis, dn/dln k=-(1.5\pm 1.2) x 10^{-2}, in agreement with inflation. The limits on the sum of neutrino masses are significantly improved: $\sum m_{\nu}<0.17\eV$ at 95% (<0.32eV at 99.9%). This result, when combined with atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing constraints, requires that the neutrino masses cannot be degenerate, m_3/m_1>1.3 (95% c.l.). Assuming a thermalized fourth neutrino we find m_s<0.26\eV at 95% c.l. and such neutrino cannot be an explanation for the LSND results. In the limits of massless neutrinos we obtain the effective number of neutrinos N_\nu^{\rm eff}=5.3^{+0.4}_{-0.6}{}^{+2.1}_{-1.7}{}^{+3.8}_{-2.5} and N_\nu^{\rm eff}=3.04 is allowed only at 2.4-sigma. The constraint on the dark energy equation of state is w=-1.04\pm 0.06. The constraint on curvature is Omega_k=-0.003\pm 0.006. Cosmic strings limits are G\mu <2.3 x 10^{-7} at 95% c.l. and correlated isocurvature models are also tightly constrained.},

abstract = {Recent cosmological data have provided new constraints on the number of neutrino species and on the neutrino mass. However these constraints depend on assumptions related to the underlying cosmology. Since a correlation is expected between the number of effective neutrinos, N_{eff}, the neutrino mass \sum M_\nu, and the curvature of the universe, \Omega_k, it is useful to investigate the current constraints in the framework of a non-flat universe. In this paper we update the constraints on neutrino parameters by making use of the latest Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the ACT and SPT experiments and consider the possibility of a universe with non-zero curvature. We first find a negative correlation between curvature and N_{eff} with a correlation coefficient of -0.36 and we place new constraints on N_{eff} and \Omega_k, with N_{eff} = 4.03 +/- 0.45 and 10^3, \Omega_k = -4.46 +/- 5.24. Thus, even when \Omega_k is allowed to vary, N_{eff} = 3 is still disfavored at 95% confidence. The correlation between neutrino mass and curvature is much stronger, with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 that shifts the 95% upper limit of \sum M_\nu < 0.446 eV to \sum M_\nu < 0.948 eV. Thus, the impact of assuming flatness in neutrino cosmology is significant and an essential consideration with future experiments.},

abstract = {We present a method for measuring the cosmic matter budget without assumptions about speculative Early Universe physics, and for measuring the primordial power spectrum P*(k) non-parametrically, either by combining CMB and LSS information or by using CMB polarization. Our method complements currently fashionable ``black box'' cosmological parameter analysis, constraining cosmological models in a more physically intuitive fashion by mapping measurements of CMB, weak lensing and cluster abundance into k-space, where they can be directly compared with each other and with galaxy and Lyman alpha forest clustering. Including the new CBI results, we find that CMB measurements of P(k) overlap with those from 2dF galaxy clustering by over an order of magnitude in scale, and even overlap with weak lensing measurements. We describe how our approach can be used to raise the ambition level beyond cosmological parameter fitting as data improves, testing rather than assuming the underlying physics.},

These simulations improve on our previous Horizon Run 1 (HR1) up to a factor of 4.4 in volume, and range from 2600 to over 8800 times the volume of the Millennium Run. In addition, they achieve a considerably finer mass resolution, down to 1.25x10^11 M_sun/h, allowing to resolve galaxy-size halos with mean particle separations of 1.2 Mpc/h and 1.5 Mpc/h, respectively. We have measured the power spectrum, correlation function, mass function and basic halo properties with percent level accuracy, and verified that they correctly reproduce the LCDM theoretical expectations, in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. Our unprecedentedly large-volume N-body simulations can be used for a variety of studies in cosmology and astrophysics, ranging from large-scale structure topology, baryon acoustic oscillations, dark energy and the characterization of the expansion history of the Universe, till galaxy formation science - in connection with the new SDSS-III. To this end, we made a total of 35 all-sky mock surveys along the past light cone out to z=0.7 (8 from the HR2 and 27 from the HR3), to simulate the BOSS geometry. The simulations and mock surveys are already publicly available at http://astro.kias.re.kr/Horizon-Run23/.},

abstract = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the WMAP mission. We provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate CMB anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (3.84+/-0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is 13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s = 0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k = -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit, the inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

abstract = {Massive spectroscopic surveys of high-redshift quasars yield large numbers of correlated Lyman {\alpha} absorption spectra that can be used to measure large-scale correlations. Simulations of these surveys are required to accurately interpret the measurements of correlations and correct for systematic errors. An efficient method to generate mock realizations of Lyman {\alpha} forest surveys is presented which generates a field over the lines of sight to the survey sources only, instead of having to generate it over the entire three-dimensional volume of the survey. The method can be calibrated to reproduce the power spectrum and one-point distribution function of the transmitted flux fraction, as well as the redshift evolution of these quantities, and is easily used for modeling any survey systematic effects. We present an example of how these mock surveys are applied to predict the measurement errors in a survey with similar parameters as the BOSS quasar survey in SDSS-III.},

@article{Ross2012,
abstract = {The SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), a five-year spectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. One of the key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a sample of $\sim$150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter distance at z\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over 2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year of the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested to meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this redshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities, the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85. While detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar spectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical studies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets deg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. This "CORE" subsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. In this paper we describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS quasar target selection algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations. We analyze the spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z>2.2 quasars were spectroscopically confirmed by BOSS. Our current algorithms select an average of 15 z > 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch SDSS imaging. Multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can further improve the efficiency and completeness of BOSS quasar target selection. [Abridged]},

@article{Vogelsberger2011,
abstract = {We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation using the new moving mesh code AREPO and compare the results with equivalent GADGET simulations based on the SPH technique. Both codes use an identical Tree-PM gravity solver and include the same sub-resolution physics for the treatment of star formation, but employ a completely different method to solve the inviscid Euler equations. This allows us to cleanly assess the impact of hydro-solver uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. In this paper, we focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et al. (2011), while Sijacki et al. (2011) uses idealised simulations to analyse differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. Global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two simulation approaches. AREPO shows systematically higher star formation rates at late times, lower mean temperatures averaged over the simulation volume, and different gas mass fractions in characteristic phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas. These striking differences originate through a higher heating rate with SPH in the outer parts of haloes, caused by viscous dissipation of SPH's inherent sonic velocity noise and SPH's efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region, and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in AREPO. These differences also produce more disk-like galaxy morphologies in the moving mesh calculations compared to SPH. Our results hence demonstrate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead to comparatively large systematic differences even at the level of predictions for the global state of baryons.

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {Continuum fitting is an important aspect of Lyman-alpha forest science, since errors in the estimated optical depths scale with the fractional continuum error. However, traditional methods of estimating continua in noisy and moderate-resolution spectra (S/N < 10 pixel^-1 and R $\sim$ 2000, respectively, such as SDSS) using power-law extrapolation or the mean spectrum, achieve no better than $\sim$ 10-15% RMS accuracy. To improve on this, we introduce mean-flux regulated/principal component analysis (MF-PCA) continuum fitting. In this technique, PCA fitting is carried out redwards of the quasar Lyman-alpha line in order to provide a prediction for the shape of the Lyman-alpha forest continuum. The slope and amplitude of this continuum prediction is then corrected using external constraints for the Lyman-alpha forest mean-flux. From tests on mock spectra, we find that MF-PCA reduces the errors to 8% RMS in S/N $\sim$ 2 spectra, and < 5% RMS in spectra with S/N > 5. The residual Fourier power in the continuum is decreased by a factor of a few in comparison with dividing by the mean continuum, enabling Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum measurements to be extended to $\sim$2x larger scales. Using this new technique, we make available continuum fits for 12,069 z>2.3 Lyman-alpha forest spectra from SDSS DR7 for use by the community. This technique is also applicable to future releases of the ongoing BOSS survey, which is obtaining spectra for $\sim$ 150,000 Lyman-alpha forest spectra at low signal-to-noise (S/N $\sim$ 2).},

SN data alone require cosmic acceleration at >99.9% confidence, including systematic effects. For the dark energy equation of state parameter (assumed constant out to at least $z=1.4$) in a flat universe, we find $w = -0.91^{+0.16}_{-0.20}(\mathrm{stat}) ^{+0.07}_{-0.14} (\mathrm{sys})$ from SNe only, consistent with a cosmological constant. Our fits include a correction for the recently discovered relationship between host-galaxy mass and SN absolute brightness. We pay particular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using a systematics covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence of these effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships. Unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic terms on the empirical light-curve models. The total systematic uncertainty is dominated by calibration terms. We describe how the systematic uncertainties can be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby and intermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated onto USNO/SDSS-like systems.},

@article{Petkova2009,
abstract = {We present a novel numerical implementation of radiative transfer in the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code {\small GADGET}. It is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration scheme where the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments of the transfer equation and by using a variable Eddington tensor as a closure relation, following the `OTVET'-suggestion of Gnedin & Abel. We derive a suitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the SPH discretization of the local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver that guarantees robustness and photon conservation. This entails a matrix inversion problem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory in our parallel code. We solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradient scheme. Finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation and recombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemical network that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. We present several tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources in static uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowing by a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field. All tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictions from other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing. However, unlike most other radiative transfer codes presently in use for studying reionisation, our new method can be used on-the-fly during dynamical cosmological simulation, allowing simultaneous treatments of galaxy formation and the reionisation process of the Universe.},

abstract = {This review discusses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity easily and highly accurately. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many applications in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

abstract = {We investigate the non-linear evolution of the relic cosmic neutrino background by running large box-size, high resolution N-body simulations. Our set of simulations explore the properties of neutrinos in a reference $\Lambda$CDM model with total neutrino masses between 0.05-0.60 eV in cold dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}-10^{15}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$, over a redshift range $z=0-2$. We compute the halo mass function and show that it is reasonably well fitted by the Sheth-Tormen formula. More importantly, we focus on the CDM and neutrino properties of the density and peculiar velocity fields in the cosmological volume, inside and in the outskirts of virialized haloes. The dynamical state of the neutrino particles depends strongly on their momentum: whereas neutrinos in the low velocity tail behave similarly to CDM particles, neutrinos in the high velocity tail are not affected by the clustering of the underlying CDM component. We find that the neutrino (linear) unperturbed momentum distribution is modified and mass and redshift dependent deviations from the expected Fermi-Dirac distribution are in place both in the cosmological volume and inside haloes. The neutrino density profiles around virialized haloes have been carefully investigated and a simple fitting formula is provided. The neutrino profile, unlike the cold dark matter one, is found to be cored with core size and central density that depend on the neutrino mass, redshift and mass of the halo, for halos of masses larger than $\sim 10^{13.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. For lower masses the neutrino profile is best fitted by a simple power-law relation in the range probed by the simulations. Our findings are particularly important in view of upcoming large-scale structure surveys, like Euclid, that are expected to probe the non-linear regime at the percent level with lensing and clustering observations.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H_0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

@article{Sijacki2011,
abstract = {We present a detailed comparison between the well-known SPH code GADGET and the new moving-mesh code AREPO on a number of hydrodynamical test problems. Through a variety of numerical experiments we establish a clear link between test problems and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation setups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting gas properties in the full cosmological framework, as highlighted in papers by Vogelsberger et al. (2011) and Keres et al. (2011). We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from infalling substructures. In idealized tests of inside-out disk formation, the convergence rate of gas disk sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction between a forming central disk and orbiting substructures in a halo, the final disk morphology is strikingly different. In AREPO, gas from infalling substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disk. Conversely, gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically transforming the disk as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably affect cosmological simulations due to their hierarchical nature. Our numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable solution.},

This procedure produces accurate photometry along with accurate estimates of the statistical uncertainty, and can be used to derive photometry taken with multiple telescopes.

We test the influence of the initial conditions, namely the pre-initial configuration (preIC), the order of the Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), and the initial redshift, on the statistics associated with the large scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, the density power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures. We find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at $z\lesssim 2$. However, the initial excess of power in the glass initial conditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the mass function at high redshifts. The LPT order used to generate the ICs of the simulations is found to play a crucial role. First-order LPT (1LPT) simulations underestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2LPT) ones, typically by 2% at $10^{14} h^{-1} M_\odot$ for an initial redshift of 23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6% near the Nyquist frequency for $z_\mathrm{ini} = 23$. Moreover, at higher redshifts, the high-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1LPT simulations. On the other hand, when the LPT order is fixed, the starting redshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {We present an analysis of high-resolution N-body simulations of decaying dark matter cosmologies focusing on the statistical properties of the transmitted Lyman-alpha forest flux in the high-redshift intergalactic medium. In this type of model a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable dark matter daughter particle and a comparably light particle. The small mass splitting provides a non-relativistic kick velocity V_k to the daughter particle resulting in free-streaming and subsequent damping of small-scale density fluctuations. Current Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements probe comoving scales up to $\sim$ 2-3 h^-1 Mpc at redshifts z $\sim$ 2-4, providing one of the most robust ways to probe cosmological density fluctuations on relatively small scales. The suppression of structure growth due to the free-streaming of dark matter daughter particles also has a significant impact on the neutral hydrogen cloud distribution, which traces the underlying dark matter distribution well at high redshift. We exploit Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements to constrain the amount of free-streaming of dark matter in such models and thereby place limits on decaying dark matter based only on the dynamics of cosmological perturbations without any assumptions about the interactions of the decay products. We find that SDSS 1D Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum data place a lifetime-dependent upper limit V_k < 30-70 km/s for decay lifetimes < 10 Gyr. This is the most stringent model-independent bound on invisible dark matter decays with small mass splittings. For large mass splittings (large V_k), Lyman-alpha forest data restrict the dark matter lifetime to Gamma^-1 > 40 Gyr. Forthcoming BOSS data should be able to provide more stringent constraints on exotic dark matter, mainly because the larger BOSS quasar spectrum sample will significantly reduce statistical errors.},

abstract = {Modern cosmological observations allow us to study in great detail the evolution and history of the large scale structure hierarchy. The fundamental problem of accurate constraints on the cosmological parameters, within a given cosmological model, requires precise modelling of the observed structure. In this paper we briefly review the current most effective techniques of large scale structure simulations, emphasising both their advantages and shortcomings. Starting with basics of the direct N-body simulations appropriate to modelling cold dark matter evolution, we then discuss the direct-sum technique GRAPE, particle-mesh (PM) and hybrid methods, combining the PM and the tree algorithms. Simulations of baryonic matter in the Universe often use hydrodynamic codes based on both particle methods that discretise mass, and grid-based methods. We briefly describe Eulerian grid methods, and also some variants of Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods.},

These measurements of H_0 and Omega_m are robust against a range of underlying models for the expansion history. We measure the dark energy equation of state parameter w = -0.92 +/- 0.13, which is consistent with a cosmological constant. If curvature is allowed to vary, we find that the Universe is consistent with a flat geometry (\Omega_K = -0.004 +/- 0.005). We also use a combination of the 6 Degree Field Galaxy Survey BAO data, WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey data, Type Ia supernovae (SN) data, and a local measurement of the Hubble constant to explore cosmological models with more parameters. Finally, we explore the effect of varying the energy density of relativistic particles on the measurement of H_0.},

abstract = {We compare two techniques for following the cooling of gas and its condensation into galaxies within high resolution simulations of cosmologically representative regions. Both techniques treat the dark matter using N-body methods. One follows the gas using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) while the other uses simplified recipes from semi-analytic (SA) models. We compare the masses and locations predicted for dense knots of cold gas (the `galaxies') when the two techniques are applied to evolution from the same initial conditions and when the additional complications of star formation and feedback are ignored. We find that above the effective resolution limit of the two techniques, they give very similar results both for global quantities such as the total amount of cooled gas and for the properties of individual `galaxies'. The SA technique has systematic uncertainties arising from the simplified cooling model adopted, while details of the SPH implementation can produce substantial systematic variations in the galaxy masses it predicts. Nevertheless, for the best current SPH methods and the standard assumptions of the SA model, systematic differences between the two techniques are remarkably small. The SA technique gives adequate predictions for the condensation of gas into `galaxies' at less than one percent of the computational cost of obtaining similar results at comparable resolution using SPH.},

The amplitude of the column density distribution, expressed as the value for the ionizing intensity, is derived as a function of the cosmological parameters (to about 40% accuracy).

abstract = {On large scales a nonlinear transformation of matter density field can be viewed as a biased tracer of the density field itself. A nonlinear transformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit, giving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a nonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We derive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation. These biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution function (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our analysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary bias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale clustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of Lyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density perturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be expressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the velocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03. Bias and primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the transformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these parameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we can match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we predict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the opposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly biased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish or change the sign.},

abstract = {We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P(k) using luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and use this measurement to sharpen constraints on cosmological parameters from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We employ a matrix-based power spectrum estimation method using Pseudo-Karhunen-Loeve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements in 20 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range 0.01h/Mpc < k < 0.2h/Mpc. Results from the LRG and main galaxy samples are consistent, with the former providing higher signal-to-noise. Our results are robust to omitting angular and radial density fluctuations and are consistent between different parts of the sky. They provide a striking confirmation of the predicted large-scale LCDM power spectrum. Combining only SDSS LRG and WMAP data places robust constraints on many cosmological parameters that complement prior analyses of multiple data sets. The LRGs provide independent cross-checks on Om and the baryon fraction in good agreement with WMAP. Within the context of flat LCDM models, our LRG measurements complement WMAP by sharpening the constraints on the matter density, the neutrino density and the tensor amplitude by about a factor of two, giving Omega_m=0.24+-0.02 (1 sigma), sum m_nu < 0.9 eV (95%) and r<0.3 (95%). Baryon oscillations are clearly detected and provide a robust measurement of the comoving distance to the median survey redshift z=0.35 independent of curvature and dark energy properties. Within the LCDM framework, our power spectrum measurement improves the evidence for spatial flatness, sharpening the curvature constraint Omega_tot=1.05+-0.05 from WMAP alone to Omega_tot=1.003+-0.010. Assuming Omega_tot=1, the equation of state parameter is constrained to w=-0.94+-0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious future LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature of dark energy. All these constraints are essentially independent of scales k>0.1h/Mpc and associated nonlinear complications, yet agree well with more aggressive published analyses where nonlinear modeling is crucial.},

@article{PlanckCollaboration2013a,
abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe, was launched on May 2009 and has been surveying the microwave and submillimetre sky since August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration publicly released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck operations, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper describes the mission and its performance, and gives an overview of the processing and analysis of the data, the characteristics of the data, the main scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. Scientific results include robust support for the standard, six parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements for the parameters that define this model, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for some of these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large scale anomalies in the CMB temperature distribution detected earlier by WMAP are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropies. There is some tension between Planck and WMAP results; this is evident in the power spectrum and results for some of the cosmology parameters. In general, Planck results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Because the analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet as mature as the analysis of temperature data, polarization results are not released. We do, however, illustrate the robust detection of the E-mode polarization signal around CMB hot- and cold-spots.},

abstract = {We have assembled a compilation of observational Hubble parameter measurements estimated with the differential evolution of cosmic chronometers, in the redshift range 0<z<1.75. This sample has been used, in combination with CMB data, to derive new constraints on several cosmological parameters. The new Hubble parameter data are very useful at breaking some of the parameter degeneracies present in CMB-only analysis and in constraining possible deviations from the standard (minimal) flat \Lambda CDM model. The H(z) data are especially useful in constraining \Omega_k and \Omega_DE in models that allow a variation of those parameters, yielding constraints that are competitive with those obtained using Supernovae and/or baryon acoustic oscillations. We also find that our H(z) data are useful to constrain parameters that do no affect directly the expansion history, by breaking or reducing degeneracies with other parameters. We find that N_rel=3.5\pm0.3 using WMAP 7-years data in combination with South Pole Telescope data and our H(z) determinations N_rel=3.7\pm0.4 using Atacama cosmology telescope data instead of South pole telescope). We exclude N_rel>4 at 95% confidence level (at 74% confidence level using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope instead). We also put competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses, m_\nu<0.24 eV at 68% confidence level. These results have been proven to be extremely robust to the initial choice of stellar population synthesis model adopted to estimate H(z).},

abstract = {We have performed a multi-species hydrodynamical simulation of the formation and evolution of Lyman alpha clouds in a flat CDM dominated universe with an external flux of ionizing radiation. We solve the fully coupled non-equilibrium rate equations for the following species: H, H^+, H^-, H_2, H_2^+, He, He^+, He^{++}, and e^-. The statistical properties of the distribution and evolution of both hydrogen and helium absorption lines are extracted and compared to observed data. We find excellent agreement for the following neutral hydrogen data: the distribution of column densities is fit well by a power law with exponent beta=1.55 with a possible deficiency of lines above column density 10^{15} cm^{-2}; the integrated distribution matches observed data over a broad range of column densities 10^{13} to 10^{17} cm^{-2}; a Gaussian statistical fit to the Doppler parameter distribution yields a median of 35.6 km s^{-1}; the evolution of the number of clouds with column densities larger than 10^{14} cm^{-2} follows a power law with exponent gamma=2.22. Analogous calculations are presented for HeII absorption lines and we find the ratio of Doppler parameters b_{HeII}/b_{HI} = 0.87. Our data also suggests that Ly$\alpha$ clouds may belong to two morphologically different groups: small column density clouds which tend to reside in sheets or filamental structures and are very elongated and/or flattened, and the large column density clouds which are typically found at the intersections of these caustic structures and are quasi-spherical.},

Meanwhile we accommodate the Lagrangian displacement distribution into the Fisher matrix calculation to reflect the gradual loss of information in scale and in time due to nonlinear growth, nonlinear bias, and nonlinear redshift distortions. We then show that we can contract the multi-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations into a 2-dimensional or even 1-dimensional formalism with physically motivated approximations. We present the resulting fitting formula for the cosmological distance errors from galaxy redshift surveys as a function of survey parameters and nonlinearity, which saves us going through the 12-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations. Finally, we show excellent agreement between the distance error estimates from the revised Fisher matrix and the precision on the distance scale recovered from N-body simulations.},

abstract = {We present results of Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS H-band imaging of 73 of most luminous (i.e., log[L_IR/L_0]>11.4) Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). This dataset combines multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data from space (Spitzer, HST, GALEX, and Chandra) and ground-based telescopes. In this paper we use the high-resolution near-infrared data to recover nuclear structure that is obscured by dust at optical wavelengths and measure the evolution in this structure along the merger sequence. A large fraction of all galaxies in our sample possess double nuclei ($\sim$63%) or show evidence for triple nuclei ($\sim$6%). Half of these double nuclei are not visible in the HST B-band images due to dust obscuration. The majority of interacting LIRGs have remaining merger timescales of 0.3 to 1.3 Gyrs, based on the projected nuclear separations and the mass ratio of nuclei. We find that the bulge luminosity surface density increases significantly along the merger sequence (primarily due to a decrease of the bulge radius), while the bulge luminosity shows a small increase towards late merger stages. No significant increase of the bulge Sersic index is found. LIRGs that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger bulge luminosity, suggesting that non merging LIRGs have larger bulge masses than merging LIRGs. This may be related to the flux limited nature of the sample and the fact that mergers can significantly boost the IR luminosity of otherwise low luminosity galaxies. We find that the projected nuclear separation is significantly smaller for ULIRGs (median value of 1.2 kpc) than for LIRGs (mean value of 6.7 kpc), suggesting that the LIRG phase appears earlier in mergers than the ULIRG phase.},

abstract = {The z > 2 Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest traces the underlying dark-matter distribution on large scales and, given sufficient sightlines, can be used to create 3D maps of large-scale structure. We examine the observational requirements to construct such maps and estimate the signal-to-noise as a function of exposure time and sightline density. Sightline densities at z = 2.25 are n_los = [360, 1200,3300] deg^{-2} at limiting magnitudes of g =[24.0, 24.5,25.0], resulting in transverse sightline separations of d_perp = [3.6, 1.9, 1.2] h^{-1} Mpc, which roughly sets the reconstruction scale. We simulate these reconstructions using mock spectra with realistic noise properties, and find that spectra with S/N = 4 per angstrom can be used to generate maps that clearly trace the underlying dark-matter at overdensities of rho/<rho> $\sim$ 1. For the VLT/VIMOS spectrograph, exposure times t_exp = [4, 6, 10] hrs are sufficient for maps with spatial resolution epsilon_3d = [5.0, 3.2, 2.3] h^{-1} Mpc. Assuming $\sim$ 250 h^{-1} Mpc is probed along the line-of-sight, 1 deg^2 of survey area would cover a comoving volume of $\sim$ 10^6 h^{-3} Mpc^3 at <z>=2.3, enabling efficient mapping of large volumes with 8-10m telescopes. These maps could be used to study galaxy environments, detect proto-clusters, and study the topology of large-scale structure at high-z.},

In cosmological analyses the effects of neutrino mass and number of species can in principle be disentangled for fixed cosmological parameters. However, since we do not have perfect measurements of the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model parameters some correlation remains between the neutrino mass and number of species, and both parameters should be included in the analysis. Combining the newest observations of several cosmological probes (cosmic microwave background, large scale structure, expansion rate) we obtain N_eff=3.58(+0.15/-0.16 at 68% CL) (+0.55/-0.53 at 95% CL) and a sum of neutrino masses of less than 0.60 eV (95 CL), which are currently the strongest constraints on N_eff and M_nu from an analysis including both parameters. The preference for N_eff >3 is now at a 2sigma level.},

abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on the first three years of the WMAP sky survey. The new maps, which are consistent with the first-year maps and more sensitive, incorporate improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. These include refinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. We employ two forms of multi-frequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signals from the CMB, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. First, we form an improved 'Internal Linear Combination' map, based solely on WMAP data, by adding a bias correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in the resulting map. Second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that trace Galactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency WMAP data to trace synchrotron emission. The WMAP point source catalog is updated to include 115 new sources. We derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy using a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l (large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l>30. Our best estimate of the CMB power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectra from 153 statistically independent channel pairs. The combined spectrum is cosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-mode exceeds unity up to l=850. The first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8 +- 0.7 and l=530.9 +- 3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen at l=412.4 +- 1.9 and l=675.1 +- 11.1, respectively. The rise to the third peak is unambiguous; when the WMAP data are combined with higher resolution CMB measurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established.},

abstract = {We present neutrino mass bounds using 900,000 luminous galaxies with photometric redshifts measured from Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Data Release Eight (SDSS DR8). The galaxies have photometric redshifts between $z = 0.45$ and $z = 0.65$, and cover 10,000 square degrees and thus probe a volume of 3$h^{-3}$Gpc$^3$, enabling tight constraints to be derived on the amount of dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. A new bound on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu < 0.26$ eV, at 95% confidence level (CL), is obtained after combining our sample of galaxies, which we call "CMASS", with WMAP 7 year Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the most recent measurement of the Hubble parameter from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This constraint is obtained with a conservative multipole range choice of $30 < \ell < 200$ in order to minimize non-linearities, and a free bias parameter in each of the four redshift bins. We study the impact of assuming this linear galaxy bias model using mock catalogs, and find that this model causes a small ($\sim 1-1.5 \sigma$) bias in $\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2$. For this reason, we also quote neutrino bounds based on a conservative galaxy bias model containing additional, shot noise-like free parameters. In this conservative case, the bounds are significantly weakened, e.g. $\sum m_\nu < 0.36$ eV (95% confidence level) for WMAP+HST+CMASS ($\ell_{\rm max}=200$). We also study the dependence of the neutrino bound on multipole range ($\ell_{\rm max}=150$ vs $\ell_{\rm max}=200$) and on which combination of data sets is included as a prior. The addition of supernova and/or Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data does not significantly improve the neutrino mass bound once the HST prior is included. [abridged]},

abstract = {The signature left in quasar spectra by the presence of neutral hydrogen in the Universe allows one to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses with improved sensitivity, with respect to laboratory experiments, and may shed a new light on the neutrino mass hierarchy and on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. Constraints on cosmological parameters and on the dark energy equation of state can also be derived, from a joint parameter estimation procedure. However, this requires a detailed modeling of the line-of-sight power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-Alpha (LyA) forest on scales ranging from a few to hundreds of Mpcs, which in turns demands the inclusion and careful treatment of cosmological neutrinos. To this end, we present here a suite of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations with cold dark matter, baryons and massive neutrinos, specifically targeted for modeling the low-density regions of the IGM as probed by the LyA forest at high-redshift. The simulations span volumes ranging from (25 Mpc/h)^3 to (100 Mpc/h)^3, and are made using either 3 X 192^3$\sim$21 millions or 3 X 768^3$\sim$1.4 billion particles. The resolution of the various runs can be further enhanced, so that we can reach the equivalent of 3 X 3072^3$\sim$87 billion particles in a (100 Mpc/h)^3 box size. The chosen cosmological parameters are compatible with the latest Planck (2013) results, although we also explore the effect of slight variations in the main cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We adopt a particle-type implementation of massive neutrinos, and consider three degenerate species having masses M_nu =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.8 eV, respectively. We improve on previous studies in several ways, in particular with updated routines for IGM radiative cooling and heating processes, and initial conditions based on 2LPT rather than the Zeldovich approximation.},

abstract = {The scientific community is presently witnessing an unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of data sets coming from simulations and real-world experiments. To access effectively and extract the scientific content of such large-scale data sets (often sizes are measured in hundreds or even millions of Gigabytes) appropriate tools are needed. Visual data exploration and discovery is a robust approach for rapidly and intuitively inspecting large-scale data sets, e.g. for identifying new features and patterns or isolating small regions of interest within which to apply time-consuming algorithms. This paper presents a high performance parallelized implementation of Splotch, our previously developed visual data exploration and discovery algorithm for large-scale astrophysical data sets coming from particle-based simulations. Splotch has been improved in order to exploit modern massively parallel architectures, e.g. multicore CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs. We present performance and scalability benchmarks on a number of test cases, demonstrating the ability of our high performance parallelized Splotch to handle efficiently large-scale data sets, such as the outputs of the Millennium II simulation, the largest cosmological simulation ever performed.},

abstract = {The SDSS-III BOSS Quasar survey will attempt to observe z>2.15 quasars at a density of at least 15 per square degree to yield the first measurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the Ly-alpha forest. To help reaching this goal, we have developed a method to identify quasars based on their variability in the u g r i z optical bands. The method has been applied to the selection of quasar targets in the SDSS region known as Stripe 82 (the Southern equatorial stripe), where numerous photometric observations are available over a 10-year baseline. This area was observed by BOSS during September and October 2010. Only 8% of the objects selected via variability are not quasars, while 90% of the previously identified high-redshift quasar population is recovered. The method allows for a significant increase in the z>2.15 quasar density over previous strategies based on optical (ugriz) colors, achieving a density of 24.0 deg^{-2} on average down to g$\sim$22 over the 220 deg^2 area of Stripe 82. We applied this method to simulated data from the Palomar Transient Factory and from Pan-STARRS, and showed that even with data that have sparser time sampling than what is available in Stripe 82, including variability in future quasar selection strategies would lead to increased target selection efficiency in the z>2.15 redshift range. We also found that Broad Absorption Line quasars are preferentially present in a variability than in a color selection.},

abstract = {Using \Planck\ data combined with the Meta Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC), we address the study of peculiar motions by searching for evidence of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (kSZ). By implementing various filters designed to extract the kSZ generated at the positions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radial peculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flow amplitude at different depths. For the whole cluster sample of average redshift 0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the kSZ monopole, amounts to $72 \pm 60$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. This constitutes less than 1\,% of the relative Hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local CMB frame. From a subset of this cluster sample \Planck\ finds the radial peculiar velocity rms to be below 800\,km\,s$^{-1}$ at the 95\,% confidence level, which is around three times the $\Lambda$CDM prediction for the typical cluster radial velocity rms at $z=0.15$. \Planck\ data also set strong constraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the Local Group. There is no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending to the maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. A blind search for bulk flows in this sample has an upper limit of 254\,km\,s$^{-1}$ (95\,% confidence level) dominated by CMB confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that the Universe is largely homogeneous on Gpc scales. In this context, in conjunction with supernova observations, \Planck\ is able to rule out a large class of inhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity. The \Planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thus consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario.},

abstract = {We describe the design, construction, and performance of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Telescope located at Apache Point Observatory. The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chretien design which has a 2.5-m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08-m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include: (1) A 3 degree diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometrical distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000 to 10,600 Angstroms) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging; (2) Very high precision motion to support open loop TDI observations; and (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in May 1998 and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for recovering primordial fluctuations from the present-day galaxy distribution, on the assumption that these fluctuations were Gaussian. The key element of the method is 'Gaussianization', a monotonic transformation of the smoothed galaxy distribution, which exploits the fact that gravitational evolution and biased galaxy formation tend to preserve the rank order of the initial density field. In tests on N-body simulations with known initial conditions, the reconstruction procedure recovers accurate maps of the initial fluctuations from fully sampled, sparsely sampled, or biased data. Evolution of the reconstructed initial conditions yields credible reproductions of the input data. Reconstruction analysis can be used to derive the properties of primordial fluctuations, to constrain biased galaxy formation and the value of Omega, and to test the hypotheses of gravitional instability and Gaussian primordial fluctuations.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H_0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

We show how the analysis of current cosmological observations, such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background or the distribution of large-scale structure, provides an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses of order 1 eV or less, with very good perspectives from future cosmological measurements which are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses well into the sub-eV range.},

abstract = {The genus of the iso-density contours is a robust measure of the topology of large scale structure, and it is relatively insensitive to nonlinear gravitational evolution, galaxy bias and redshift-space distortion. We show that the growth of density fluctuations is scale-dependent even in the linear regime in some modified gravity theories, which opens a new possibility of testing the theories observationally. We propose to use the genus of the iso-density contours, an intrinsic measure of the topology of large scale structure, as a statistic to be used in such tests. In Einstein's general theory of relativity, density fluctuations are growing at the same rate on all scales in the linear regime, and the genus per comoving volume is almost conserved as structures are growing homologously, so we expect that the genus-smoothing scale relation is basically time-independent. However, in some modified gravity models where structures grow with different rates on different scales, the genus-smoothing scale relation should change over time. This can be used to test the gravity models with large scale structure observations. We studied the case of the f(R) theory, DGP braneworld theory as well as the parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) models. We also forecast how the modified gravity models can be constrained with optical/IR or redshifted 21cm radio surveys in the near future.},

abstract = {We apply the reconstruction technique to the clustering of galaxies from the SDSS DR7 LRG sample, sharpening the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature and achieving a 1.9% measurement of the distance to z=0.35. This is the first application of reconstruction of the BAO feature in a galaxy redshift survey. We update the reconstruction algorithm of Eisenstein et al, 2007 to account for the effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions and validate it on 160 LasDamas simulations. We demonstrate that reconstruction sharpens the BAO feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function, reducing the nonlinear smoothing scale \Sigma_nl from 8.1 Mpc/h to 4.4 Mpc/h. Reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-space distortions at the BAO scale, isotropizing the correlation function. This sharpened BAO feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (< 0.2%) and reduces the scatter from 3.3% to 2.1%. We demonstrate the robustness of these results to the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, the galaxy bias and the linear growth rate. Applying this reconstruction algorithm to the SDSS LRG DR7 sample improves the significance of the BAO feature in these data from 3.3 sigma for the unreconstructed correlation function, to 4.2 sigma after reconstruction. We estimate a relative distance scale D_V/r_s to z=0.35 of 8.88+/-0.17, where r_s is the sound horizon and D_V = (D_A^2/H)^{1/3} is a combination of the angular diameter distance D_A and Hubble parameter H. Assuming a sound horizon of 154.25 Mpc, this translates into a distance measurement D_V (z=0.35) = 1.356+/-0.025 Gpc. We find that reconstruction reduces the distance error in the DR7 sample from 3.5% to 1.9%, equivalent to a survey with three times the volume of SDSS.},

abstract = {We present forecasts for the accuracy of determining the parameters of a minimal cosmological model and the total neutrino mass based on combined mock data for a future Euclid-like galaxy survey and Planck. We consider two different galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shear survey. We make use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and assume two sets of theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for uncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear galaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated in Fourier space. The second error is meant to parametrize the overall residual uncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at small scales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase with the ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. It hence increases with wavenumber and decreases with redshift. With these two assumptions for the errors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error rises above 2% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future Euclid-like cosmic shear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on Mnu close to 32 meV/25 meV, sufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance. If the residual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly towards smaller scales in the non-linear regime as we have assumed here then the data on non-linear scales does not increase the sensitivity to the total neutrino mass. Assuming instead a ten times smaller theoretical error with the same scale dependence, the error on the total neutrino mass decreases moderately from sigma(Mnu) = 18 meV to 14 meV when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/Mpc < k < 0.6 h/Mpc are included in the analysis of the galaxy survey data.},

abstract = {We present results from fitting the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the correlation function obtained from the first application of reconstruction to a galaxy redshift survey, namely, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogue. We also introduce more careful approaches for deriving a suitable covariance matrix and fitting model for galaxy correlation functions. These all aid in obtaining a more accurate measurement of the acoustic scale and its error. We validate our reconstruction, covariance matrix and fitting techniques on 160 mock catalogues derived from the LasDamas simulations in real and redshift space. We then apply these techniques to the DR7 LRG sample and find that the error on the acoustic scale decreases from $\sim$3.5% before reconstruction to $\sim$1.9% after reconstruction. This factor of 1.8 reduction in the error is equivalent to the effect of tripling the survey volume. We also see an increase in our BAO detection confidence from $\sim$3-sigma to $\sim$4-sigma after reconstruction with our confidence level in measuring the correct acoustic scale increasing from $\sim$3-sigma to $\sim$5-sigma. Using the mean of the acoustic scale probability distributions produced from our fits, we find D_v/r_s = 8.89 +/- 0.31 before reconstruction and 8.88 +/- 0.17 after reconstruction.},

abstract = {Properties of dark matter halos are reviewed. Taken from different publications, we present results on (1) the mass and velocity functions, (2) density and velocity profiles, and (3) concentration of halos. In the range of radii r=(0.005-1)rvir the density profile for a quiet isolated halo is very accurately approximated by a fit suggested by Moore etal (1997): rho=1/x^1.5(1+x^1.5), where x=r/rs and rs is a characteristic radius. The fit suggested by Navarro et al (1995) rho= 1/x(1+x)^2, also gives a very satisfactory approximation with relative errors of about 10% for radii not smaller than 1% of the virial radius. The mass function of z=0 halos with mass below 10^{13}Msun/h is approximated by a power law with slope alpha =-1.85. The slope increases with the redshift. The velocity function of halos with Vmax< 500km/s is also a power law with the slope beta= -3.8-4. The power-law extends to halos at least down to 10km/s. It is also valid for halos inside larger virialized halos. The concentration of halos depends on mass (more massive halos are less concentrated) and environment, with isolated halos being less concentrated than halos of the same mass inside clusters. Halos have intrinsic scatter of concentration: at 1sigma level halos with the same mass have Delta(log{c_vir})=0.18 or, equivalently, DeltaVmax/Vmax =0.12. Velocity anisotropy for both subhalos and the dark matter is approximated by beta(r) =0.15+2x/[x^2+4], where x is radius in units of the virial radius.},

abstract = {We present variability and multi-wavelength photometric information for the 933 known quasars in the QUEST Variability Survey. These quasars are grouped into variable and non-variable populations based on measured variability confidence levels. In a time-limited synoptic survey, we detect an anti-correlation between redshift and the likelihood of variability. Our comparison of variability likelihood to radio, IR, and X-ray data is consistent with earlier quasar studies. Using already-known quasars as a template, we introduce a light curve morphology algorithm that provides an efficient method for discriminating variable quasars from periodic variable objects in the absence of spectroscopic information. The establishment of statistically robust trends and efficient, non-spectroscopic selection algorithms will aid in quasar identification and categorization in upcoming massive synoptic surveys. Finally, we report on three interesting variable quasars, including variability confirmation of the BL Lac candidate PKS 1222+037.},

@article{Andreon2011,
abstract = {Current analysis of astronomical data are confronted with the daunting task of modeling the awkward features of astronomical data, among which heteroscedastic (point-dependent) errors, intrinsic scatter, non-ignorable data collection (selection effects), data structure, non-uniform populations (often called Malmquist bias), non-Gaussian data, and upper/lower limits. This chapter shows, by examples, how modeling all these features using Bayesian methods. In short, one just need to formalize, using maths, the logical link between the involved quantities, how the data arise and what we already known on the quantities we want to study. The posterior probability distribution summarizes what we known on the studied quantities after the data, and we should not be afraid about their actual numerical computation, because it is left to (special) Monte Carlo programs such as JAGS. As examples, we show how to predict the mass of a new object disposing of a calibrating sample, how to constraint cosmological parameters from supernovae data and how to check if the fitted data are in tension with the adopted fitting model. Examples are given with their coding. These examples can be easily used as template for completely different analysis, on totally unrelated astronomical objects, requiring to model the same awkward data features.},

@article{Hess2009,
abstract = {Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a well-established approach to model fluids in astrophysical problems, thanks to its geometric flexibility and ability to automatically adjust the spatial resolution to the clumping of matter. However, a number of recent studies have emphasized inaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities. The origin of these numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across contact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the particle level. We here investigate a new fluid particle model where the density estimate is carried out with the help of an auxiliary mesh constructed as the Voronoi tessellation of the simulation particles instead of an adaptive smoothing kernel. This Voronoi-based approach improves the ability of the scheme to represent sharp contact discontinuities. We show that this eliminates spurious surface tension effects present in SPH and that play a role in suppressing certain fluid instabilities. We find that the new `Voronoi Particle Hydrodynamics' described here produces comparable results than SPH in shocks, and better ones in turbulent regimes of pure hydrodynamical simulations. We also discuss formulations of the artificial viscosity needed in this scheme and how judiciously chosen correction forces can be derived in order to maintain a high degree of particle order and hence a regular Voronoi mesh. This is especially helpful in simulating self-gravitating fluids with existing gravity solvers used for N-body simulations.},

For our purposes we target quasars using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry to a magnitude limit of $g=22$. The efficiency and completeness of this technique is measured using the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data, taken in 2010. This technique was used as the CORE method for target selection for BOSS Year One spectroscopy to be realized in the 9th SDSS data release. When targeting at a density of 40 objects per sq-deg (the BOSS quasar targeting density) the efficiency of this technique in recovering $z>2.2$ quasars is 40%. The completeness compared to all quasars identified in BOSS Data is 65%. This paper also describes possible extensions and improvements for this technique.},

@article{Bolton2013,
abstract = {We present new measurements of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z$\sim$2.4 derived from absorption line profiles in the Lyman-alpha forest. We use a large set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to calibrate the relationship between the temperature-density relation in the IGM and the distribution of HI column densities, N_HI, and velocity widths, b_HI, of discrete Lyman-alpha forest absorbers. This calibration is then applied to the measurement of the lower cut-off of the b_HI-N_HI distribution recently presented by Rudie et al. (2012). We infer a power-law temperature-density relation, T=T_0\Delta^(\gamma-1), with a temperature at mean density, T_0=[1.00^+0.32_-0.21] x10^4 K and slope (\gamma-1)=0.54\pm 0.11. The slope is fully consistent with that advocated by the analysis of Rudie et al. (2012); however, the temperature at mean density is lower by almost a factor of two, a difference due primarily to an adjustment in the relationship between column density and physical density assumed by these authors. These new results bring the b_HI-N_HI cut-off constraint into excellent agreement with the recent temperature measurements of Becker et al. (2011), based on the curvature of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-alpha forest. The fact that independent analyses using different techniques constrain IGM temperatures to less than 30 per cent and are mutually consistent suggests that the thermal state of the IGM at this redshift is now reasonably well characterised, at least over the range of densities probed by these methods. Future works using these and other techniques should be able to further clarify the thermal structure and evolution of the IGM at a level of precision sufficient to deliver new insights into cosmic reionisation and the properties of ionising sources.},

abstract = {Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and their effects on the matter power spectrum can be studied by using the Lyman-alpha absorption signature of the matter density field along quasar (QSO) lines of sight. A measurement sufficiently accurate to provide useful cosmological constraints requires the observation of $\sim$100000 quasars in the redshift range 2.2<z<3.5 over $\sim$8000 deg2. Such a survey is planned by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) project of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III).In practice, one needs a stellar rejection of more than two orders of magnitude with a selection efficiency for quasars better than 50% up to magnitudes as large as g $\sim$ 22. To obtain an appropriate target list and estimate quasar redshifts, we have developed an Artificial Neural Networks (NN) with a multilayer perceptron architecture. The input variables are photometric measurements, i.e. the object magnitudes and their errors in the five bands (ugriz) of the SDSS photometry. For target selection, we achieve a non-quasar point-like object rejection of 99.6% and 98.5% for a quasar efficiency of, respectively, 50% and 85%. The photometric redshift precision is of the order of 0.1 over the region relevant for BAO studies.},

abstract = {In the low density intergalactic medium (IGM) that gives rise to the Lyman-alpha forest, gas temperature and density are tightly correlated. The velocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans scale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J $\sim$ sigma_th). To separate the effects of gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare spectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations evolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans scales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved particle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux autocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather than pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a cancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T $\sim$ rho^{0.6} in our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure simulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation, and it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal broadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably important effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds directly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it is smooth. Tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statistical results are converged even at this lower resolution. While thermal broadening generally dominates the longitudinal structure in the Lya forest, we show in Paper II that pressure support determines the transverse coherence of the forest observed towards close quasar pairs.

abstract = {[abridged] We describe LyMAS (Ly-alpha Mass Association Scheme), a method of predicting clustering statistics in the Ly-alpha forest on large scales from moderate resolution simulations of the dark matter distribution, with calibration from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of smaller volumes. We use the "Horizon MareNostrum" simulation, a 50 Mpc/h comoving volume evolved with the adaptive mesh hydrodynamic code RAMSES, to compute the conditional probability distribution P(F_s|delta_s) of the transmitted flux F_s, smoothed (1-dimensionally) over the spectral resolution scale, on the dark matter density contrast delta_s, smoothed (3-dimensionally) over a similar scale. In this study we adopt the spectral resolution of the SDSS-III BOSS at z=2.5, and we find optimal results for a dark matter smoothing length sigma=0.3 Mpc/h (comoving). In extended form, LyMAS exactly reproduces both the 1-dimensional power spectrum and 1-point flux distribution of the hydro simulation spectra. Applied to the MareNostrum dark matter field, LyMAS accurately predicts the 2-point conditional flux distribution and flux correlation function of the full hydro simulation for transverse sightline separations as small as 1 Mpc/h, including redshift-space distortion effects. It is substantially more accurate than a deterministic density-flux mapping ("Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation"), often used for large volume simulations of the forest. With the MareNostrum calibration, we apply LyMAS to 1024^3 N-body simulations of a 300 Mpc/h and 1.0 Gpc/h cube to produce large, publicly available catalogs of mock BOSS spectra that probe a large comoving volume. LyMAS will be a powerful tool for interpreting 3-d Ly-alpha forest data, thereby transforming measurements from BOSS and other massive quasar absorption surveys into constraints on dark energy, dark matter, space geometry, and IGM physics.},

abstract = {We compute the evolution of spatially flat, mixed cold and hot dark matter (``MDM") models containing both baryonic matter and two kinds of dark matter. The mean final Zeldovich-Sunyaev $y$ parameter is estimated to be $\bar y=(5.4\pm 2.7)\times 10^{-7}$, with a rms fluctuation of approximately $\bar{\delta y}=(6.0\pm 3.0)\times 10^{-7}$ on arc minute scales. The rate of galaxy formation peaks at an even later epoch ($z\sim 0.3$) than in the standard ($\Omega=1$, $\sigma_8=0.67$) CDM model ($z\sim 0.5$) and, at a redshift of z=4 is nearly a factor of a hundred lower than for the CDM model with the same value of $\sigma_8$. The model yields a cluster mass function which is about a factor of 4 higher than observed but a cluster-cluster correlation length lower by a factor of 2 than what is observed but both are closer to observations than in the COBE normalized CDM model. The one dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion is $605\pm 8$km/s at $1h^{-1}$ separation, lower than that of the CDM model normalized to COBE, but still significantly higher than observations (Davis \& Peebles 1983). A plausible velocity bias $b_v=0.8\pm 0.1$ on this scale will reduce but not remove the discrepancy. Overall, the model is similar both on large and intermediate scales to the standard CDM model normalized to the same value of $\sigma_8$, but the problem with regard to late formation of galaxies is more severe in this model than in that CDM model. Adding hot dark matter significantly improves the ability of COBE normalized CDM scenario to fit existing observations, but the model is in fact not as good as the CDM model with the same $\sigma_8$ and is still probably unsatisfactory with regard to several critical tests.},

abstract = {At the heart of any method for computational fluid dynamics lies the question of how the simulated fluid should be discretized. Traditionally, a fixed Eulerian mesh is often employed for this purpose, which in modern schemes may also be adaptively refined during a calculation. Particle-based methods on the other hand discretize the mass instead of the volume, yielding an approximately Lagrangian approach. It is also possible to achieve Lagrangian behavior in mesh-based methods if the mesh is allowed to move with the flow. However, such approaches have often been fraught with substantial problems related to the development of irregularity in the mesh topology. Here we describe a novel scheme that eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. A particularly powerful feature of the approach is that the mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are given the velocity of the local flow, a highly accurate Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics is obtained that is free of mesh distortion problems, while it is at the same time fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes. We describe the formulation and implementation of our new Voronoi-based hydrodynamics, and we discuss a number of illustrative test problems that highlight its performance in practical applications.},

abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the non-linear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

abstract = {A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omega_m h^2, baryon density, Omega_b h^2, Hubble Constant, H_0, amplitude of fluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also small scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat LCDM model are (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, h, n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032, 0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). The three year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino properties. Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps.},

abstract = {Highly supersonic, compressible turbulence is thought to be of tantamount importance for star formation processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). Likewise, cosmic structure formation is expected to give rise to subsonic turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM), which may substantially modify the thermodynamic structure of gas in virialized dark matter halos and affect small-scale mixing processes in the gas. Numerical simulations have played a key role in characterizing the properties of astrophysical turbulence, but thus far systematic code comparisons have been restricted to the supersonic regime, leaving it unclear whether subsonic turbulence is faithfully represented by the numerical techniques commonly employed in astrophysics. Here we focus on comparing the accuracy of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and our new moving-mesh technique AREPO in simulations of driven subsonic turbulence. To make contact with previous results, we also analyze simulations of transsonic and highly supersonic turbulence. We find that the widely employed standard formulation of SPH quite badly fails in the subsonic regime. Instead of building up a Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade, large-scale eddies are quickly damped close to the driving scale and decay into small-scale velocity noise. In contrast, our moving-mesh technique does yield power-law scaling laws for the power spectra of velocity, vorticity and density, consistent with expectations for fully developed isotropic turbulence. This casts doubt about the reliability of SPH for simulations of cosmic structure formation, especially if turbulence in clusters of galaxies is indeed significant. In contrast, SPH's performance is much better for supersonic turbulence, as here the flow is kinetically dominated and characterized by a network of strong shocks, which can be adequately captured with SPH.

@article{Klypin2000,
abstract = {We give a summary of recent results on spatial and velocity biases in cosmological models. Progress in numerical techniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a such accuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters of galaxies. Halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus, can be used to study the biases -- differences between galaxies and the dark matter. The biases depend on scale, redshift, and circular velocities of selected halos. Two processes seem to define the evolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias and (2) merger bias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces the number of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter). There are two kinds of velocity bias. The pair-wise velocity bias is b_12=0.6-0.8 at r< 5Mpc/h, z=0. This bias mostly reflects the spatial bias and provides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies and the dark matter. One-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities. Inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v =1.1-1.3) than the dark matter. Qualitatively this result can be understood using the Jeans equations of the stellar dynamics. For the standard LCDM model we find that the correlation function and the power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scales r<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc.},

abstract = {We present a suite of cosmological N-body simulations with cold dark matter and baryons aiming at modeling the low-density regions of the IGM as probed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forests at high redshift. The simulations are designed to match the requirements imposed by the quality of BOSS and eBOSS data. They are made using either 2x768$^3$ or 2x192$^3$ particles, spanning volumes ranging from (25 Mpc.h$^{-1})^3$ for high-resolution simulations to (100 Mpc.h$^{-1})^3$ for large-volume ones. Using a splicing technique, the resolution is further enhanced to reach the equivalent of simulations with 2x3072$^3$= 58 billion particles in a (100 Mpc.h$^{-1}$)^3 box size, i.e. a mean mass per gas particle of 1.2x10$^5$M_sun.h$^{-1}$. We show that the resulting power spectrum is accurate at the 2% level over the full range from a few Mpc to several tens of Mpc. We explore the effect on the one-dimensional transmitted-flux power spectrum of 4 cosmological parameters ($n_s, \sigma_8, \Omega_m, H_0$) and 2 astrophysical parameters ($T_0, \gamma$) related to the heating rate of the IGM. By varying the input parameters around a central model chosen to be in agreement with the latest Planck results, we built a grid of simulations that allows the study of the impact on the flux power spectrum of these six relevant parameters. We improve upon previous studies by not only measuring the effect of each parameter individually, but also probing the impact of the simultaneous variation of each pair of parameters. We thus provide a full second-order expansion, including cross-terms, around our central model. We check the validity of the second-order expansion with independent simulations obtained either with different cosmological parameters or different seeds. Finally, a comparison to the one-dimensional Ly-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum obtained with BOSS shows an excellent agreement.},

abstract = {Using a sample of approximately 14,000 z>2.1 quasars observed in the first year of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), we measure the three-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the Lyman-alpha forest. The angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (F = exp(-tau)) is securely detected out to comoving separations of 60 Mpc/h, the first detection of flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. A quadrupole distortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities, the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. We obtain a good fit to the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias of the transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard LCDM cosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). At 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16<b<0.24 and redshift-distortion parameter 0.44<beta<1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, with a well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. The errors on beta are asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. The value of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and our tests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectations for the Lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column density systems and metal line absorption. These results set the stage for cosmological parameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the Lyman-alpha forest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acoustic oscillations.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent results on lognormal statistics showing that the moment hierarchy of a lognormal variable completely fails at capturing its information content in the large variance regime, we discuss in this work the inadequacy of the hierarchy of correlation functions to describe a correlated lognormal field, which provides a roughly accurate description of the non-linear cosmological matter density field. We present families of fields having the same hierarchy of correlation functions than the lognormal field at all orders. This explicitly demonstrates the little studied though known fact that the correlation function hierarchy never provides a complete description of a lognormal field, and that it fails to capture information in the non-linear regime, where other simple observables are left totally unconstrained. We discuss why perturbative, Edgeworth-like approaches to statistics in the non-linear regime, common in cosmology, can never reproduce or predict that effect, and why it is however generic for tailed fields, hinting at a breakdown of the perturbation theory based on the field fluctuations. We make a rough but successful quantitative connection to N-body simulations results, that showed that the spectrum of the log-density field carries more information than the spectrum of the field entering the non-linear regime.},

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h^{-3} Gpc^3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h^{-1} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega_mh^2 to 8% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega_m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w_0) + 0.137 Omega_K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega_K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the Lyman alpha flux probability distribution function (PDF) measured from a set of eight high resolution quasar spectra with emission redshifts at 3.3 < z < 3.8. We carefully study the effect of metal absorption lines on the shape of the PDF. Metals have a larger impact on the PDF measurements at lower redshift, where there are fewer Lyman alpha absorption lines. This may be explained by an increase in the number of metal lines which are blended with Lyman alpha absorption lines toward higher redshift, but may also be due to the presence of fewer metals in the intergalactic medium with increasing lookback time. We also provide a new measurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, tau_eff, at 2.8 < z < 3.6, and find no evidence for a deviation from a power law evolution in the log(tau_eff)-log(1+z) plane. The flux PDF measurements are furthermore of interest for studies of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z $\sim$ 3 . By comparing the PDF to state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we place constraints on the temperature of the IGM and compare our results with previous measurements of the PDF at lower redshift. At redshift z=3, our new PDF measurements are consistent with an isothermal temperature-density relation, T=T_0 Delta^{gamma-1}, with a temperature at the mean density of T_0 = 19250 +/- 4800 K and a slope gamma=0.90+/-0.21 (1 sigma uncertainties). In comparison, joint constraints with previous PDF measurements at z<3 favour an inverted (gamma<1) temperature-density relation with T_0=17900 +/- 3500 K and gamma=0.70 +/- 0.12, in broad agreement with previous analyses.},

abstract = {The Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) is an optical survey designed to locate quasars during the epoch of reionization. In this paper we present the discovery of the first four CFHQS quasars at redshift greater than 6, including the most distant known quasar, CFHQS J2329-0301 at z=6.43. We describe the observational method used to identify the quasars and present optical, infrared, and millimeter photometry and optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We investigate the dust properties of these quasars finding an unusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminosity due to dust emission for another. The mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS quasars is substantially lower than that for SDSS quasars at the same redshift, likely due to a correlation with quasar UV luminosity. For two quasars with sufficiently high signal-to-noise optical spectra, we use the spectra to investigate the ionization state of hydrogen at z>5. For CFHQS J1509-1749 at z=6.12, we find significant evolution (beyond a simple extrapolation of lower redshift data) in the Gunn-Peterson optical depth at z>5.4. The line-of-sight to this quasar has one of the highest known optical depths at z$\sim$5.8. An analysis of the sizes of the highly-ionized near-zones in the spectra of two quasars at z=6.12 and z=6.43 suggest the IGM surrounding these quasars was substantially ionized before these quasars turned on. Together, these observations point towards an extended reionization process, but we caution that cosmic variance is still a major limitation in z>6 quasar observations.},

abstract = {Leapfrog integration has been the method of choice in N-body simulations owing to its low computational cost for a symplectic integrator with second order accuracy. We introduce a new leapfrog integrator that allows for variable timesteps for each particle in large N-body simulations. Tests with single particles in fixed potentials show that it behaves as a symplectic integrator. We then examine the results of both standard leapfrog and our temporally adaptive leapfrog on full N-body integrations of clusters and large scale structure establishing accuracy criteria for both methods. The adaptive method shows significant speed-ups over single step integrations---but the integrator no longer appears to be symplectic or, in the case of large scale structure simulations, accurate. This loss of accuracy appears to be caused by the way that the timestep is chosen, not by the integrator itself. We present a related integration technique that does retain sufficient accuracy. Although it is not symplectic, it is apparently better than previous implementations and is our current integrator of choice for large astrophysical simulations. We also note that the standard leapfrog difference equations used in cosmological N-body integrations in comoving coordinates are not symplectic. We derive an implementation of leapfrog that is in comoving canonical coordinates to correct for this deficiency.},

Crucial complementary information on neutrino masses can be obtained from the analysis of data on cosmological observables, such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background or the distribution of large-scale structure. In this review we describe in detail how free-streaming massive neutrinos affect the evolution of cosmological perturbations. We summarize the current bounds on the sum of neutrino masses that can be derived from various combinations of cosmological data, including the most recent analysis by the WMAP team. We also discuss how future cosmological experiments are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses well into the sub-eV range.},

abstract = {Context: Strings and other alternative theories describing the quantum properties of space-time suggest that space-time could present a foamy structure and also that, in certain cases, quantum gravity (QG) may manifest at energies much below the Planck scale. One of the observable effects could be the degradation of the diffraction images of distant sources. Aims: We searched for this degradation effect, caused by QG fluctuations, in the light of the farthest quasars (QSOs) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope with the aim of setting new limits on the fluctuations of the space-time foam and QG models. Methods: We developed a software that estimates and compares the phase variation in the interference patterns of the high-redshift QSOs, taken from the snapshot survey of HST-SDSS, with those of stars that are expected to not be affected by QG effects. We used a two-parameter function to determine, for each test star and QSO, the maximum of the diffraction pattern and to calculate the Strehl ratio. Results: Our results go far beyond those already present in the literature. By adopting the most conservative approach where the correction terms, that describe the possibility for space-time fluctuations cumulating across long distances and partially compensate for the effects of the phase variations, are taken into account. We exclude the random walk model and most of the holographic models of the space-time foam. Without considering these correction terms, all the main QG scenarios are excluded. Finally, our results show the absence of any directional dependence of QG effects and the validity of the cosmological principle with an independent method; that is, viewed on a large scale, the properties of the Universe are the same for all observers, including the effects of space-time fluctuations.},

abstract = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264,283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance Lambda-CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc^3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n = 3 x 10^-4 h^-3 Mpc^3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5\sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7\sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

@article{Scoccimarro1998,
abstract = {The standard procedure to generate initial conditions (IC) in numerical simulations is to use the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). Although the ZA correctly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the ZA failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We extend perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as non-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the IC. We focus on higher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence, characterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. We find that the time-scale of transients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. The skewness factor S_3 (T_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0, whereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the IC. These requirements become much more stringent as p increases. An Omega=0.3 model requires a factor of two larger expansion than an Omega=1 model to reduce transients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good agreement with numerical simulations. More accurate IC can be achieved by using 2nd order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to 2nd order and thus eliminates transients in the skewness. We show that for p>3 this reduces the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared to the ZA. Setting up 2LPT IC only requires minimal, inexpensive changes to ZA codes. We suggest simple steps for its implementation.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities, Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega_L, are each determined to a precision of $\sim$1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r<0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is <0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {We present a study of the effect of High Column Density (HCD) systems on the Lyman \alpha forest correlation function on large scales. We study the effect both numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific model, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear theory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the noise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the measured redshift-space correlation function of the Lyman \alpha forest, increasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift distortion parameter $\beta_\alpha$ of the Lyman \alpha forest. We provide simple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of the mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs, and discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In practice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Lyman \alpha forest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple analytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped wings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we conclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained numerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Lyman \alpha cross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct for the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Lyman \alpha forest spectra.},

@article{Pieri2010,
abstract = {We present a new method for probing the physical conditions and metal enrichment of the Intergalactic Medium: the composite spectrum of Ly-alpha forest absorbers. We apply this technique to a sample of 9480 Ly-alpha absorbers with redshift 2 < z < 3.5 identified in the spectra of 13,279 high-redshift quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Fifth Data Release (DR5). Absorbers are selected as local minima in the spectra with 2.4 < tau_Ly-alpha < 4.0; at SDSS resolution ($\sim$ 150km/s FWHM), these absorbers are blends of systems that are individually weaker. In the stacked spectra we detect seven Lyman-series lines and metal lines of O VI, N V, C IV, C III, Si IV, C II, Al II, Si II, Fe II, Mg II, and O I. Many of these lines have peak optical depths of < 0.02, but they are nonetheless detected at high statistical significance. Modeling the Lyman-series measurements implies that our selected systems have total H I column densities N_HI $\sim$ 10^15.4cm-2. Assuming typical physical conditions rho / <rho> = 10, T = 10^4 - 10^4.5 K, and [Fe/H]= -2 yields reasonable agreement with the line strengths of high-ionization species, but it underpredicts the low-ionization species by two orders of magnitude or more. This discrepancy suggests that the low ionization lines arise in dense, cool, metal-rich clumps, present in some absorption systems.},

@article{Bond1997,
abstract = {We develop two methods for estimating the power spectrum, C_l, of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from data and apply them to the COBE/DMR and Saskatoon datasets. One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood function, and the other is an estimator that is a minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the quadratic estimator is not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same C_ls. The quadratic estimator can also be used to directly determine cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O(N^3) operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets with arbitrary chopping patterns and noise correlations. We also discuss approximations that may reduce it to O(N^2) thus making it practical for forthcoming megapixel datasets.},

  abstract={This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, V ud & V us , V cb & V ub , fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review . All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: pdg.lbl.gov [http://pdg.lbl.gov] .}
